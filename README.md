# Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with Transformer Model

## Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive implementation of a **Multimodal Sentiment Analysis** model that classifies tweets based on both text and images into four sentiment categories: "Certainly Fake," "Probably Fake," "Probably Real," and "Certainly Real." The model employs **RoBERTa** for text encoding, **DenseNet** for image encoding, and a **Transformer architecture** for effective feature fusion. The implementation tracks key performance metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, and loss, during the training process.
