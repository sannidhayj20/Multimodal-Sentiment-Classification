# Multimodal-Sentiment-Classification

This notebook demonstrates a multimodal sentiment analysis approach using RoBERTa for text encoding, DenseNet for image encoding, and a Transformer model for feature fusion. The goal is to classify tweets based on text and images into sentiment categories: "Certainly Fake," "Probably Fake," "Probably Real," and "Certainly Real." Key metrics tracked include accuracy, F1-score, and loss over training epochs, with the best-performing models saved.
