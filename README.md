# Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with Transformer Model

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of a multimodal sentiment analysis model that classifies tweets based on both text and images into four sentiment categories: "Certainly Fake," "Probably Fake," "Probably Real," and "Certainly Real." The model leverages RoBERTa for text encoding, DenseNet for image encoding, and a Transformer architecture for feature fusion. Key performance metrics tracked during training include accuracy, F1-score, and loss.
